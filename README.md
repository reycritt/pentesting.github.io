  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  When posting a comment, entered the following to display the current poster's cookies:
  
  "<script>prompt(document.cookie)</script>" 
  
 This script is more inconspicuous has it is not easily visible nor detectable, and can be combined with a normal comment to further avoid suspicion.

  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  The following was done in Firefox:
  When the specified user is logged in, use the given text document "hack3.txt" to change the user's profile information. Change the ".txt" suffix to ".html", which will launch the html code and open the user's profile with new values updated from the malicious file.
  Note: The values used were located using BurpSuite. The values "_wpnonce" and "color-nonce change" each time the user logs in, so these values need to be updated in the html text document every time a login occurs.

    - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36954
    
    
3. XSS Vulnerability
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types:
    Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version:
    WordPress 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 
    WordPress 5.1.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  <img src='https://recordit.co/6uJGNAraMv.gif' title='XSS 2' width='' alt='XSS 2' />
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  In comments, submitted the following:
  <form action="[some website link]">
  <input type="submit" value=""/>
  </form>
  The input type "submit" is simply a button, but can be changed to something less visible/obvious, and has the potential to sending a user to an inappropriate website like an unwanted add or an HTML site built to steal user information.
