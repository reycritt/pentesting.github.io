2. CSRF Vulnerability
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types:
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Tested in version:
    Wordpress 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 
    
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  The following was done in Firefox:
  When the specified user is logged in, using the following text document to change the profile information:
  
  Change the ".txt" suffix to ".html", which will launch the html code and open the user's profile with new values updated from the malicious file.
  Note: The values used were located using BurpSuite. The values "_wpnonce" and "color-nonce change" each time the user logs in, so these values need to be updated in the html text document every time a login occurs.

3. XSS Vulnerability
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types:
    Cross-Site Scripting
    - Tested in version:
    WordPress 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 
    
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
  In comments, submitted the following:
  <form action="[some website link]">
  <input type="submit" value=""/>
  </form>
  The input type "submit" is simply a button, but can be changed to something less visible/obvious, and has the potential to sending a user to an inappropriate website like an unwanted add or an HTML site built to steal user information.
